<h2 style="text-align: center;">WHAT TO EXPECT FROM YOUR<br />
CHILD&rsquo;S WELL EXAM</h2>

<p>At your child&rsquo;s well child visit, the following services are included:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Measurement of growth parameters and provision of growth charts</li>
	<li>Vision screens beginning at age 3</li>
	<li>Hearing screens beginning at age 4</li>
	<li>Measurement of blood pressure beginning at age 3</li>
	<li>A complete physical examination</li>

<p>We will certainly try to address any additional questions and issues you may have.&nbsp; However, if a concern requires more than a five minute discussion, we may ask you to schedule a subsequent visit to more fully address all of your concerns on non-wellness related topics.&nbsp; Some insurance plans allow us to bill both a sick and a well visit on the same day. <u><strong>If your plan does allow this and if time allows, we will attempt to address all concerns today.&nbsp; Because of the extra time involved, you may incur an additional charge.</strong></u>&nbsp; Please let us know if you have any questions and thank you for your understanding.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) announced that Village Pediatrics of Chapel Hill has received Recognition from the Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) program for using evidence-based, patient-centered processes that focus on highly coordinated care and long-term relationship.</p>

<p>Research shows that medical homes can lead to high quality and lower costs, and improve patients&rsquo; and providers&rsquo; reported experiences of care. The PCMH identifies practices that promote partnerships between individual patients and their personal clinicians, instead of treating patient care as the sum of several episodic office visits. Medical home practices demonstrate the benchmarks of patient-centered care, including open scheduling, expanded hours and appropriate use of proven health information systems.</p>

<h2><label for="tab-4a">What is a Medical Home?</label></h2>

<div class="tab-content">
<p>The mission of Village Pediatrics is to provide the highest standard of acute and preventative medicine to all children and adolescents by applying the American Academy of Pediatrics Medical Home Philosophy to all children, of all ages, and all demographics. The AAP defines a medical home as primary care that is accessible, continuous, comprehensive, family centered, coordinated, compassionate, and culturally effective.</p>

<p>At Village Pediatrics, we believe that every child deserves a medical home. To accomplish our goal, we combine state of the art electronic medical records, <a href="https://mycw3.eclinicalweb.com/gush/jsp/100mp/login_otp.jsp" target="_blank">online patient access</a>, a large panel of insurance companies, and open access scheduling to provide you with the high quality, accessible medical care you and your family deserve.</p>

<p>&quot;A sick child is far more than a medical file. Children are sisters, brothers, and grandchildren. They are students, athletes, church members and an integral part of the village that we all live in. It takes a village isn&rsquo;t just a motto. It is our philosophy. It has always been my philosophy, and it is wonderful to be working at Village Pediatrics with others who share that commitment.&quot; - <strong>Maria Mekeel, RN</strong></p>

<p><br />
Comprehensive pediatric primary care requires not only good medicine, but also counseling, friendship, support, and community involvement. Come see how our commitment to quality care makes us different. Schedule your no cost meet the doctor visit today by calling 919-969-9611.</p>
